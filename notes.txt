Замечания от Gemini:


I'd be glad to review your project structure and offer suggestions for improvement:

Overall Structure:

    The basic structure with name, description, author, dates, and folders seems sound.
    Consider adding a version element to track project iterations.
    Include a license element if you have one chosen.

Folder Organization:

    dbase:
        Looks good. You might add a version of the schema used if relevant.
    events:
        Instead of nested main within events, create sibling folders:
            event_handlers for event-handling logic.
            models for defining event data structures.
            views for rendering event-related templates.
            tests for event-related unit tests.
            Keep static and templates within events as-is.
        Use descriptive names for content generators (e.g., event_content.py).

Files:

    project.xml: Consider renaming it to config.xml or settings.xml for clarity.
    run.py: Depending on your project type, rename it to something more specific (e.g., start_development.py or launch_application.py).

Additional Recommendations:

    Version control: Use Git or another system to track changes and collaborate.
    Documentation: Add a README.md file with details on setup, usage, and contributions.
    Naming conventions: Use consistent naming (e.g., lowercase with underscores for Python, PascalCase for JavaScript).
    Testing: Add unit and integration tests for crucial parts.

Tailored Advice:

Please share more context about your project:

    Purpose (e.g., web application, data analysis tool)
    Programming language usage in each folder
    Any specific concerns or questions

With more information, I can provide more targeted suggestions for your project structure.
